Purpose:
 
Provide
 
a
 
standardized
 
procedure
 
for
 
identifying,
 
containing,
 
documenting,
 
and
 
escalating
 
food
 
safety

Incident:
 
Any
 
event
 
that
 
may
 
impact
 
product
 
safety,
 
legality,
 
or
 
regulatory
 
compliance
 
(e.g.,
 
pathogen
 
positive
 
results,
 
foreign
 
material,

product).
 
 
1.2
 
Affected
 
Lot:
 
Any
 
lot
 
produced
 
during

window
 
that
 
may
 
be
 
impacted
 
by
 
the
 
incident.

control,
 
and
 
prevent
 
environmental
 
pathogens
 
that
 
may
 
impact
 
product
 
safety.
 
This
 
program
 
establishes
 
standardized
 
procedures
 
for
 
sampling,
 
testing,
 
response,
 
corrective
 
actions,
